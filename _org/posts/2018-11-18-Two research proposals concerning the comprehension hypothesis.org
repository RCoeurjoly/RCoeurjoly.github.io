The first proposal is concerned with learning stenography. The second, with programming.
# Stenography 
Stenography is 'the action or process of writing in shorthand and transcribing the shorthand on a typewriter'.
The traditional method of learning stenography is very similar to the traditional method of language learning.
It consists of a combination of rules, translation and practice. It is low efficiency has the result of a high attrition rate.
I propose a learning method consistent with the comprehension hypothesis.
It consists of reading the shorthand while simultaneously listening to the audio version of the same text.

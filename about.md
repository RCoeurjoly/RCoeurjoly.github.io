Hi, I'm Zac! I'm a student studying Computer Science at George Mason
University.  I'm passionate about technology and building awesome
software that improves peoples' lives.

Outside of the technology world, I love music, hiking, and travel. I'm
also a proud [CBYX](http://www.usagermanyscholarship.org) alum!

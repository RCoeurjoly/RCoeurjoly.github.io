SRCT Schedules is an open source project made by [Mason
SRCT](https://srct.gmu.edu) that helps students explore the courses
available at GMU. It also provides utilities such as exporting class
schedules to calendar managers.

I am the project manager of Schedules. In this role, I serve as both
the Lead Developer and the point of contact for anyone interested in
contributing to the project. Schedules has attracted many students who
are just getting started with open source, and I've been very happy to
help them make their first contributions and teach them the basics of
the open source workflow and web development.

The project's source code is availble on SRCT's GitLab
[here](https://git.gmu.edu/srct/schedules), and the site itself is
available at [https://schedules.gmu.edu](https://schedules.gmu.edu).
